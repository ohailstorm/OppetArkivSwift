#Öppet Arkiv For tvOS
This is a tvOS version of [Öppet Arkiv](http://www.oppetarkiv.se/).

Since http://www.oppetarkiv.se/ isn't using https, I'm setting the NSAllowsArbitraryLoads to true in NSAppTransportSecurity. As this feature will soon be depricated in for apps in the App Store, I won't release this app in the app store. Feel free to run it on your own Apple TV using a usb cable and xcode.

This app is only developed to parse video urls from the publicly available site http://www.oppetarkiv.se/. I do not own the content on http://www.oppetarkiv.se/ and the app is only used for personal use.
